Build a sales tracker that uses AJAX calls to track inventory and sales for a small business. There are two roles within the MVC app.

## sales associate
-    can see complete inventory to help customers
-   make a sale, which reduces inventory and increases revenue
-   process a return which returns an item to inventory and credits a refund
-   see all of my sales, and make comments that only I can see
-   calculate my commission based on my individual sales
##  manager
-   see inventory AND costs for inventory items
-   review and edit sales by all sales associates, to correct for errors
-   view sales associate comments on sales
-   see commission for all sales associates
-   add or remove sales associates
-   add new inventory for sale, including item cost and sale price
-   see the total balance sheet for the entire store (revenue - costs = profit)
